								<h2>About me<br />
								</h2>
								<p>My name is Adams Zelaya, I am an undergraduate at Western Governors University. <br />
								Growing up I always had a niche for technology, I always liked learning how things worked within different pieces of tech. 
								I would go on and even start taking classes in highschool 
								learning the basics of coding, how to build computers, learning how to use different softwares, etc. 
								Even though I learned a lot in tech, there was still more that I wanted to learn. From there I began having 
								an interest in cybersecurity after learning more from friends and family. My interest grew so fast that I started taking courses about cybersecurity,
								and even went ahead and aquired a few certifications. Presesnt day I am currently work in the IT industry and am looking to make that transition into cybersecurity.
